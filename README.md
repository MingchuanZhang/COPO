# A Constrained Offline Policy Optimization

### COPO :
    1. Offline reinforcement learning with cost evaluation network
    2. Lagrange multiplier with PID update based on EMA
    3. Policy network with deep residual network structure
### Usage
    1. Load your own dataset in the main file and correctly define the state-action space dimension
    2. Write the environment file Env
    3. Modify the eval_policy file as needed
```
Run main.py file
